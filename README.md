# MyThermostat
An open thermostat design based on ESP32 and Angular.

Your home's thermostat should just work and not have to have an internet connection to function. It should be easy to program. It should integrate with a home automation system, but not require it. This project is my attempt to satisfy those goals using a bunch of modern technologies, many of which are new to me.
